I created this blog as my 2024 new years resolution, and while I think new years resolutions are usually a joke, I wanted to take this one seriously.

Content creation (especially writing) is the antithesis of content consumption, as it takes a conscious effort to compile your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a way that makes sense.

Due to this, I wanted to find a platform that would last a long time and allow me to say what I want without fear of censorship or deplatforming.
