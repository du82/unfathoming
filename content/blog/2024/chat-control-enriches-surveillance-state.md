The European Union has proposed a bill known as [CSAR](https://unfathom.ing) (often referred to as Chat Control), which was marketed as a way to protect children online through the use of mandatory client-side scanning of encrypted messages.

Specifically, the bill would:
* Mandate scanning of all private chats, messages, and emails for suspicious content, including on end-to-end encrypted services
* Use AI and other technologies to scan content before it is encrypted or transmitted
* Apply to all communication services, including messaging apps, email providers, and cloud storage services

Despite the fact that [protecting children's safety requires end-to-end encryption](https://simplex.chat/blog/20240601-protecting-children-safety-requires-e2e-encryption.html), regulators have attempted to push Chat Control as the answer.
