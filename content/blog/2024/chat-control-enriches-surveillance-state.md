The European Union has proposed a bill known as [CSAR](https://unfathom.ing) (often referred to as Chat Control), which was proposed as a way to protect children online through the use of mandatory client-side scanning of encrypted messages.

Specifically, the bill would:
* Mandate scanning of all private chats, messages, and emails for suspicious content, including on end-to-end encrypted services
* Use AI and other technologies to scan content before it is encrypted or transmitted
* Apply to all communication services, including messaging apps, email providers, and cloud storage services

Despite the fact that [protecting children's safety requires end-to-end encryption](https://simplex.chat/blog/20240601-protecting-children-safety-requires-e2e-encryption.html), regulators have attempted to push Chat Control as the answer. 

Lets not sugarcoat it: the chat control proposal is designed to take away freedoms from the average person and enrich governmental surveillance powers. Why else would [EU interior ministers want to exempt themselves](https://www.eureporter.co/business/data/mass-surveillance-data/2024/04/15/leak-eu-interior-ministers-want-to-exempt-themselves-from-chat-control-bulk-scanning-of-private-messages/) from the scanning? Or, why would Germany [want to reduce sentences for those who posess or distribute illegal material](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/german-lawmakers-have-not-voted-decriminalise-possessing-child-pornography-2024-06-19/)?
