I thought I'd reflect on the past two years of college and share the thoughts with you all.

I started college roughly two years ago after pressure from family to go. I reluctantly went, despite people in the industry telling me it didn't help them.

The first semester was fine, I expected a slow start becuase they have to bring everyone up to speed with the industry and work with a wide variety of skillsets, from experts to people who have never used a computer before. The first semester was nothing special, it was all content that you could teach yourself in a weekend with some YouTube videos and free software (except for a math class which was pretty good and taught me a lot).

The rest of the first year was surprisingly lacking, especially if you exclude the topics that you could teach yourself with YouTube and a free AWS virtual machine in a weekend.

> Why am I paying $500 a course for online classes where the teacher takes a week to respond to a simple question, and the course content is purchased from sites like Teachers Pay Teachers?
