I thought I'd reflect on the past two years of college and share the thoughts with you all.

I started college roughly two years ago after pressure from family to go. I reluctantly went, despite people in the industry telling me it didn't help them. From the beginning I thought of college from the perspective of *"I'm the customer, your job is to teach me something new and introduce me to concepts I didn't think of"*, which I think is a fair trade considering the steep cost.

The first semester was fine, I expected a slow start becuase they have to bring everyone up to speed with the industry and work with a wide variety of skillsets, from experts to people who have never used a computer before. The first semester was nothing special, it was all content that you could teach yourself in a weekend with some YouTube videos and free software (except for a math class which was pretty good and taught me a lot).

Something that I noticed early on was that most of the course content was 5-10 years out of date. For a cybersecurity degree, this is awful! The virtual machines we used were from 2019 (which was five years ago now!). I thought it was just becuase we're starting out, and I hoped that it would improve. *Little did I know, it was foreshadowing*.

I thought to myself:
> Why am I paying $500 a course for online classes where the teacher takes a week to respond to a simple question, and the course content is purchased from sites like Teachers Pay Teachers?

The rest of the first year was more of the same. At this point I realized that professors were using AI to respond to students, which bothered me considering the cost. Really? Can't they take a few hours out of their day to answer questions that they should know the answers to? *This is more foreshadowing*.

## Summer classes
I took two online summer courses to maximize the amount of credits per year. One was an interpersonal communications class, the other was a class on ethics, morals, and philosophical things. Lets just say they had a strong liberal bias that even people I know on the left weren't ok with (I'm a centrist) and leave it at that.

## Second semester
The second semester was more of the same. I learned how to manage a four year old version of Active Directory which may be useful someday when I need to set up AD things for an organization. Still, nothing that I couldn't learn on my own, especially since I run my own virtual machine infrastructure with Proxmox at a global scale :)

One class was essentially using AI to make presentations about a topic and turn in the presentation. This is also when I realized that quite a few teachers were using AI to generate course content and feedback. That same class was interesting because the teacher introduced me to a former student who had similar interests on the surface. Lesson learned: Don't put a cryptoanarchist and a moralist together. It did not go well.

The rest of my second semester was more of the same from the first semester, but it seemed to have gotten ***worse*** than the first semester! An example of this being configuring an AWS EC2 instance, gaining shell access, and installing some software on it. That part was fine, but there was no instruction on how to secure it. A little odd for a cybersecurity course/degree, right?
