I thought I'd reflect on the past two years of college and share the thoughts with you all.

I started college roughly two years ago after pressure from family to go. I reluctantly went, despite people in the industry telling me it didn't help them. From the beginning I thought of college from the perspective of *"I'm the customer, your job is to teach me something new and introduce me to concepts I didn't think of"*, which I think is a fair trade considering the steep cost.

The first semester was fine, I expected a slow start becuase they have to bring everyone up to speed with the industry and work with a wide variety of skillsets, from experts to people who have never used a computer before. The first semester was nothing special, it was all content that you could teach yourself in a weekend with some YouTube videos and free software (except for a math class which was pretty good and taught me a lot).

Something that I noticed early on was that most of the course content was 5-10 years out of date. For a cybersecurity degree, this is awful! The virtual machines we used were from 2019 (which was five years ago now!). I thought it was just becuase we're starting out, and I hoped that it would improve. Little did I know, it was foreshadowing.

I thought to myself:
> Why am I paying $500 a course for online classes where the teacher takes a week to respond to a simple question, and the course content is purchased from sites like Teachers Pay Teachers?
