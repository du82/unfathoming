title: Rejecting platform trajectory

It doesn't take a genius to look online and see the state of the internet to know that this is generally true. Most platforms have fallen to [enshittification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification "enshittification"), political correctness, and [sterilization](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1bk81at/comment/kvx1jzw "sterilization"). This has led to a more closed off internet where ideas outside of the mainstream, any amount of controversy, as well as workarounds to the established rules will get you [deplatformed](https://discord.com/safety/off-platform-behaviors-policy-explainer "deplatformed").

It doesn't need to be this way. Platforms don't _have_ to treat their users as cattle to be counted and rewarded based on output. You can _reject platform trajectory_

## What needs to be done?

That was until they put most users behind a paywall and [raised $330m in corporate bond sales](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/telegram-secures-330-million-bond-sales-4204066 "raised $330m in corporate bond sales").

## Matrix
The Matrix network inspired me to create this post, as it's a network and platform that's not afflicted with the disease of centralization.
