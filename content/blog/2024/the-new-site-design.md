title: The new site design

Welcome to the new Unfathoming. I've gone through three notable iterations of the site now, first on [quartz]() by Jacky Zhao, second entirely static, with me manually writing HTML for every single page (and dealing with the consequences of trying to keep 50+ pages looking consistent), and thirdly (hopefully finally) what you're looking at right now.

The new site is written with the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator because it's super simple with few dependencies and it is something I could learn in a [morning before sunrise](/blog/2024/a-rainy-saturday-morning).

While most people use WordPress, I hate how long simple actions take. Even just loading a page can take a long time.
