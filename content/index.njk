<h2>Hello there,</h2>
<p>I'm an aspiring generalist in the field of computer science with a focus on offensive cybersecurity. I care a lot about privacy and freedom, and I write (usually open source) software that helps restore and improve privacy.</p>
<p>This site, Unfathoming, is a capsule of my thoughts and ideas over time so that others may benefit from the things that float around in my head. In the event that I disappear, this site will serve as a reference as to who I am/was.</p>
<p>I recommend reading on a device with a large screen if you can. It gives you the ability to see the sidebar as well as sidenotes and other things that you might enjoy.</p>
{% callout "info", "Please visit the site on a device with a large screen, lots of context is missing on mobile due to lacking the width required for sidenotes." %}
<p>{{ morePosts }} more post{% if morePosts != 1 %}s{% endif %} can be found in <a href="/archive/">the archive</a>.</p>
