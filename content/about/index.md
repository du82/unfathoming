As stated on the homepage, I am an aspiring generalist in the field of computer science. I've worked with [most](/blog/2024/why-linux/) technologies that a consumer could access with a budget of $10,000. I encourage you to check out [my programming journey](/blog/2024/my-programming-journey) and [my research journey](blog/2024/my-research-journey) for more detailed information.

My one exception is Windows; I grew up on Linux and never found my way over to Windows land. In school we used Chromebooks (which are Linux under the hood), so the Microsoft ecosystem is foreign to me.

## Skills and expertise
I have an extensive background in computer networking, both physically as well as in software. I currently specialize in the field of covert communications.

I've written, deployed, and secured two full-stack mobile apps on the Google Play store with a combined 900,000 download count. That network was also open to third-party clients, of which there were over 20 million installs connecting back to my infrastructure.

On the topic of infrastructure, I also have experience in virtualization (VMware, Proxmox), real-time communication (Matrix), and building my own cloud from scratch (hardware and software).

## Languages
I'm fluent in American English and know some domain-specific Mandarin.
<br>As for programming languages, I am reasonably good at: Rust, Dart, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Crystal.

## Current occupation
Seeking full-time employment

## Personal values
I value privacy and self-sovereignty above all.

## Political lean
I am a libertarian with some aspects of agorism. Unless it interferes with my rights, I probably don't have an opinion on it.
