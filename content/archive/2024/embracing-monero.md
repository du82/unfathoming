Many people have asked me why I use Monero and care so much about privacy, so here's my answer.

Most traditional banks are not just storing your money; they're harvesting some of the most sensitive data about you. Every transaction you make paints a picture of your life - your habits, your preferences, your politics, and more than you could ever imagine. Banks coordinate with insurance companies and advertising agencies to analyze our transaction data in search of ways to charge us more or manipulate our buying behavior.

The Fourth Amendment protects us from unreasonable searches by the government, yet most people roll over and give up when private entities essentially conduct invasive searches of their financial lives. They treat it as part of the cost of doing business in modern America, or they believe it is necessary for fraud prevention.

While proponents argue that financial surveillance *can* help prevent fraud, this benefit is vastly outweighed by what I call the "assumed consent" model, where agreements from decades ago are used to assume consent into new privacy-invading initiatives. The current banking system actively works to squeeze every bit of value from your personal data, sharing it with insurance companies, tech giants, and advertisers.

Monero offers an alternative to this invasive and exploitative assumed consent model. Its privacy-focused design ensures that my financial transactions remain just that - mine. It's not about having something to hide; it's about maintaining the basic right to privacy in an increasingly invasive digital world. It's a way to voice my disapproval of the surveillance capitalism model which most banks are engaged in.
