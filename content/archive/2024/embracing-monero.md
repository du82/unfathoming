Many people have asked me why I use Monero and care so much about privacy, so here's my answer.

Most traditional banks are not just storing your money; they're harvesting some of the most sensitive data about you. Every transaction you make paints a picture of your life - your habits, your preferences, your politics, and more than you could ever imagine. Banks coordinate with insurance companies and advertising agencies to analyze our transaction data in search of ways to charge us more or manipulate our buying behavior.

The Fourth Amendment protects us from unreasonable searches by the government, yet most people roll over and give up when private entities essentially conduct invasive searches of their financial lives. They treat it as part of the cost of doing business in modern America, or they believe it is necessary for fraud prevention.

While proponents argue that financial surveillance *can* help prevent fraud, this benefit is vastly outweighed by what I call the "assumed consent" model, where agreements from decades ago are used to assume consent into new privacy-invading initiatives. The current banking system actively works to squeeze every bit of value from your personal data, sharing it with insurance companies, tech giants, and advertisers.

Monero offers an alternative to this invasive and exploitative assumed consent model. Its privacy-focused design ensures that my financial transactions aren't shared with the highest bidders. It's not about having something to hide; it's about maintaining the basic right to privacy in an increasingly invasive digital world. It's a way to voice my disapproval of the surveillance capitalism model which most banks and financial institutions are engaged in.

## The tangibility of surveillance capitalism
As a readily available example, I often find myself in situations where I need to use mobile hotspot, typically while traveling. On top of unlimited data, Verizon tries to charge a $10 monthly subscription for mobile data. As a user of GrapheneOS, I have the ability to modify the response to the ping that looks for hotspot usage, forcing the phone to lie about hotspot usage, which prevents the additional charge on top of unlimited data.

While this isn't directly related to banking, it opened my eyes to the tangibility of surveillance capitalism and how it gets average people to spend extra on things that should be included in the cost of the basic service.
