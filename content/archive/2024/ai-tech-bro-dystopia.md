Recently there was a discussion on my network about AI and its ability to scan Matrix chat messages. This user proposed a way to decrypt and scan messages to deanonymize users.

The scary thing is that AI can indeed accurately pick out a specific person from a large group of anonymous users by analyzing their digital behavior patterns, including typing style, word choice, and social interactions. This leads to a situation where not only is end-to-end encryption broken, but the anonymous parties involved are subject to deanonymization.
