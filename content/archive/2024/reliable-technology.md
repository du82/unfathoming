## Main laptop
Instead of a desktop, I went with a dual laptop setup. My main laptop is a *Lenovo Legion Y740-17IRH* and it has so far been a great laptop for me. It works well with Linux, and has enough ports for everything I do. Now it sits on my desk right under my networking switch and rarely moves, but when I used to travel with it, it was amazing for that.

I don't demand much of this laptop beyond finding ways to [[Conquer the stack]], it just needs to be able to compile code, run the Tor browser, and run Minecraft as well sometimes. I got it during COVID when computers were relatively cheap for the specifications that you could get, so I got one that would last me 10-15 years with room to grow.

## Keyboard
I use a customized *[Launch Heavy](https://system76.com/accessories/launch)* keyboard from System76 that's got a layout meant specifically for me, since all of the joints in my fingers are double jointed and hitting backspace and other keys in their usual places causes pain after prolonged use. The backspace key is to the *left* of the space bar, see photo below. The keyboard also has firmware modifications so I can type Chinese characters with the number pad by remembering a series of codes that are associated with sounds. This truly is a 10/10 keyboard for programmers and hackers.

I went with the Kailh Box Jades initially but they turned out to be too clicky and they didn't have enough resistance, so I swapped them out for [Kailh Speed Pro Heavy](https://keychron.com.es/products/kailh-speed-pro-heavy-switch) switches.

## Mouse
I use a [*MX Master 3S*](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006556.html) which I actually think is a downgrade from the original MX Master mouse because it doesn't fit as nicely in my hand as the original. I have one of the original MX Master mice as well, but for whatever reason it gets very dirty quickly and is not easy to clean compared to the 3S.

## Small laptop
My small laptop is a *Lenovo Yoga 14" 2018 edition*. It was a gift from my family since my previous computer died and I lacked the skills to repair it at the time. It's been the laptop I've taken with me on all of my trips, and it's been the one I've used to make the majority of the Minecraft content that I've sold over the years. Currently it has a dual boot config with debloated Windows 10 (only for Minecraft) and Pop!_OS (for everything else).

## Game console
I sometimes{% sidenote "Not as much as I used to or would like to" %} play games, and I want a game console that doesn't lock me into its ecosystem, so I went with a maxxed out Steam Deck; the one with the frosted glass screen and the nicer case. I've got a dock for it as well, and it suits my lifestyle well.

## Phones
I recently got an unlocked [Google Pixel 7a](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7a) (running [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) due to the #privacy benefits it brings) after being told that being a cybersecurity professional with a phone that's years out of date (in terms of security) is unacceptable, especially with the kinds of services that I host and being a political target. I have two old phones that I still keep around for various things (like checking WeChat) but they rarely leave home.

## Storage
While they are expensive, I love the SanDisk Pro Blade series of storage devices, and I keep a few of the drives with me whenever I travel, encrypted of course. I used to carry around bare SSDs, but that led to catastrophic data loss, destruction, and other failures.

## Operating System
I love virtual machines, so most of what I do runs inside of one, typically inside of Qubes OS. I will not use Windows for anything personal unless there's significant amounts of money to be made and the ONLY way to earn it relies on Windows software (such as Minecraft content sales).
