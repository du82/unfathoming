I was recently analyzing network traffic on my communications network to see if a campaign against attacks was beneficial in the first part of March. From that, I realized that out of 15,497 servers, the campaign made a noticeable impact on the frequency and type of attack.

I thought that some of you might be interested to visually see what attacks from state actors look like on an encrypted communications network, so I have compiled a variety of graphs from various data sources within my network and what follows is a series of graphs along with explanations as to why this data is important, what I've learned from it. Here's some interesting data I thought I'd share.
