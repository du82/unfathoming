It doesn't take a genius to look online and see the state of the internet to know that this is generally true. Most platforms have fallen to [enshittification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification "enshittification"), political correctness, and [sterilization](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1bk81at/comment/kvx1jzw "sterilization"). This has led to a more closed off internet where ideas outside of the mainstream, any amount of controversy, as well as workarounds to the established rules will get you [deplatformed](https://discord.com/safety/off-platform-behaviors-policy-explainer "deplatformed").

It doesn't need to be this way. Platforms don't _have_ to treat their users as cattle to be counted and rewarded based on output. You can _reject platform trajectory_.

## What needs to be done?

## Centralized networks
I saw Telegram as the last "free" (as in speech and beer) centralized platform in the Western world. That was until they put most features behind a paywall{% sidenote "Telegram Premium was released in 2022 as a way to fund the app. To force users to subscribe, they put popular features behind the Premium paywall." %} and [raised $330m in corporate bond sales](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/telegram-secures-330-million-bond-sales-4204066 "raised $330m in corporate bond sales").

This highlights the primary flaw of centralized networks: the ability for a single operator to control and exploit their users. Centralized platforms offer no guarantee of accountability, as it's been proven time and time again that no matter how bad a platform gets, people will stay because their friends are there. {% sidenote "Discord is [another example](/archive/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord) of a network exploiting its users for profit and control." %}

## Peer-to-peer networks
Peer to peer is an interesting option that offers the best resiliance at the cost of stability. Since there is no agreement between peers to maintain a standard of quality, they have no reason or incentive to provide one. This makes them impractical for use with large-scale encrypted group messaging.

One example of this is 

## Federated networks
I believe the solution to our problems was popularized in the 90's. No, it's not Email, but the idea of a user-facing federated networks.

Federated networks are sovereign, resistant to deplatforming, and potentially the best solution to the problem of censorship. Most{% sidenote "SimpleX Chat puts in a lot of effort towards the metadata problem, but no solution is perfect." %} federated networks have one critical flaw; excessive metadata sharing between untrusted servers.
