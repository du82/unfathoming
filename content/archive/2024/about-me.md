I'm Du Cheng, an aspiring generalist in the vast world of computer science. My journey began with Linux as a child, and since then, I've been on a mission to understand as much of the tech landscape as possible. This curiosity has led me to explore a wide variety of technologies, from [mobile app development](/archive/2024/my-programming-journey/) to building a [privacy focused search engine from scratch](/archive/2024/building-a-search-engine).

One of my guiding principles has been to gain hands-on experience with as many technologies as possible. I've worked with nearly every consumer-accessible tech within a $10,000 budget, bas I believe strongly that practical experience is the best teacher. This approach has given me a unique perspective on the strengths and limitations of various tools and platforms.

## Skills and expertise
I have an extensive background in computer networking, both physically as well as in software. I currently specialize in the field of covert communications.

I've written, deployed, and secured two full-stack mobile apps on the Google Play store with a combined 900,000 download count. That network was also open to third-party clients, of which there were over 20 million installs connecting back to my infrastructure.

On the topic of infrastructure, I also have experience in virtualization (VMware, Proxmox), real-time communication (Matrix), and building my own cloud from scratch (hardware and software).

## Languages
I'm fluent in American English and know some domain-specific Mandarin.
<br>As for programming languages, I am reasonably good at: Rust, Dart, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Crystal.

## Current occupation
Seeking full-time employment

## Personal values
I value privacy and self-sovereignty above all. I believe that you should have the right to do as you wish, but also that you should accept the consequences (good or bad) for whatever you do, so you should consider those consequences before doing as you wish.

## Political lean
I am a libertarian with some aspects of agorism. Unless it interferes with my rights, I probably don't have an opinion on it. Lots of people get angry over headlines and things they don't understand, and I try to not have an opinion until I truly understand a topic I'm learning about.

## Fun facts or quirks

## Favorite books, movies, or music
I like reading blogs and websites mostly, so here's a list of my favorites: [Trilema](https://trilema.com), [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net), [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com)

## Pets
I have a cat named Scout. I found him outside in the freezing cold when I went to let my dog out. The dog ran over and sniffed a pile of snow which I thought was odd, so I ran over in the snow (barefoot of course) and found a scrawny kitten, only a week or two old, freezing to death. I brought him back to life and he's been my companion for a few years now.

## Awards or achievements
My work has appeared in a local newspaper and I've successfully completed a few bug bounties.

## Cultural background

## Social media handles
I don't use social media. None at all {% sidenote "I really [hate Discord](/archive/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord) with a passion" %}. I am [against social media](/archive/2024/against-social-media) and if you find people claiming to be me on Reddit or whatever, they are liars.
