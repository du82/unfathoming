I'm Du, an aspiring generalist in the world of computer science. My journey began with being introduced to Linux when I was eight years old, and since then, I've been on a mission to understand as much of the tech landscape as possible. This curiosity has led me to explore a wide variety of technologies, from [mobile app development](/archive/2024/my-programming-journey/) to building a [privacy focused search engine from scratch](/archive/2024/building-a-search-engine).

One of my guiding principles has been to gain hands-on experience with as many technologies as possible. I've worked with nearly every consumer-accessible tech within a $1,000 budget, as I believe strongly that practical experience is the best teacher. This approach has given me a unique perspective on the strengths and limitations of various tools and platforms.

## Skills and expertise
I specialize in covert communications with extensive experience in computer networking, both hardware and software. I have:

- Developed and shipped three full-stack mobile apps on Google Play, amassing 1.2 million downloads.
- Managed a network infrastructure supporting 20 million third-party client connections.
- Expertise in virtualization (VMware, Proxmox), real-time communication (Matrix), and custom cloud infrastructure development.

## Languages
I'm fluent in American English and know some domain-specific Mandarin.
As for programming languages, I am reasonably proficient in:

- **Rust**: Developed a search engine in pure Rust, including spider, indexer, and dynamic HTML generator (without any JavaScript).
- **Dart**: Built two cross-platform mobile apps using Flutter, including a privacy-focused messaging app and a superapp.
- **JavaScript**: Created this website.
- **Kotlin**: Developed three native Android apps, including two seperate clients for a Minecraft content viewer and a peer-to-peer chat app.
- **Crystal**: Reimplemented all of my finance calculators and two backend services related, which resulted in a 3x speed increase.

## Current occupation
Seeking full-time employment

## Personal values
I value privacy and self-sovereignty above all. I believe that you should have the right to do as you wish, but also that you should accept the consequences (good or bad) for whatever you do, so you should consider those consequences before doing as you wish.

## Political lean
As a libertarian, I prioritize individual liberty and the free flow of information. My views are rooted in principles rather than partisan politics or fringe ideologies. I'm an advocate for fundamental freedoms, including those of speech, press, and assembly. I value objectivity and truth, even when it challenges prevailing narratives or social norms.

## Awards or achievements
My work has appeared in a local newspaper{% sidenote "I wasn't too thrilled with their finished article, It didn't capture the ideas and reasons for doing what I do that were discussed in the interview." %} and I've successfully completed a few privately ran bug bounties. I'm also the person behind the [Privacy Spreadsheet](/archive/2024/privacy-spreadsheet) project, which aims to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the privacy of a variety of software and services.

## Favorite books, movies, or music
I like reading blogs and websites mostly, so here's a list of my favorites: [Trilema](https://trilema.com), [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net), [Less Wrong](https://lesswrong.com). I don't watch movies or TV shows, but I do listen to music and podcasts, primarily in Chinese. I've never liked Western music, but I do enjoy the occasional classical piece.

## Pets
I have a cat named Scout. I found him outside in the freezing cold when I went to let my dog out. The dog ran over and sniffed a pile of snow which I thought was odd, so I ran over in the snow (barefoot of course) and found a scrawny kitten, only a week or two old, freezing to death. I brought him back to life and he's been my companion for a few years now.

## Social media usage
I don't use social media. None at all{% sidenote "I really [hate Discord](/archive/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord) with a passion" %} due to the destruction of society's collective mental wellbeing that's resulted from its use. I am [against social media](/archive/2024/against-social-media) and if you find people claiming to be me on Reddit or whatever, they are liars.

## Fun facts or quirks
I struggle with insomnia, often finding myself caught in that [liminal space](/archive/2024/liminal-spaces) between alertness and exhaustion. During these nocturnal hours, I often write code, chat with people on Dread, and occasionally dictate thoughts into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which form the basis of these blog posts.
