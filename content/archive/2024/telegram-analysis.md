## Introduction
Telegram is a messsaging app that was founded in 2013 by Nikolai and Pavel Durov. It's become a phenomenon in most of the world, with 950 million monthly active users. What I think is most interesting about it is its simple and intutitive, yet powerful design.

## User Interface
The user interface of Telegram is like that of most other messengers; a simple list of chats that can be opened to show a timeline of messages. What fascinates me about the design is the elegance to which Telegram hides complexity. For example, the ability to send a message to yourself is hidden behind the "Saved Messages" chat. This is a feature that I use often, but it's not something that I need to see all the time.
