The western world is misunderstanding superapps. As someone who's developed two of them and worked for a Chinese company that develops one, I feel qualified to write about this topic.

Superapps were created to achieve three primary goals: Reduce context shift between apps by offering a consistant user interface, lock users into a walled garden therefore increasing retention, and sidestep restrictions on Apple's app store by offering web-based apps inside of a specialized browser with deep integration.

This naturally works towards a philosophy of centralized control over the experience, or in simple terms; everything you can imagine in one app.
