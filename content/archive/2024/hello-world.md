Welcome to Unfathoming, a blog born from a New Year's resolution to improve my English writing skills. Inspired by the fascinating niche blogs I've encountered, I decided to carve out my own corner of the internet.

Here, I'll explore and share my thoughts, research, and experiences on a variety of topics, primarily centered around privacy, security, and other areas of computer science that interest me. My interests also extend to the darker corners of the internet, including the dark web and its implications for online anonymity, free markets, and censorship resistance.

## Why?
As I see it, content creation (especially writing) is [the antithesis of content consumption](/archive/2024/the-antithesis-of-content-consumption), as it takes a conscious effort to compile your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a way that makes sense.

To free my mind from the chaos of life, and break the feedback loop, I need something productive to do that has a tangible output, like writing an article. So much of what goes on in my life currently is intangible. I write code that others use, and the only thing I receive in return is the potential that my code is used to work towards overseas projects.

## Why the name "Unfathoming"?
{% callout "note", "Definition of Unfathoming:<br>Unfathoming: Synonym of Unfathomable. Present tense. To find hard to believe, not in a way rooted in skepticism, but because it is a difficult reality to process."%}

I picked this name because it's a word that represents my life and who I am. I'm one of those people who has a boring life on the surface, but go a little deeper and you'll find that it's anything but boring. I was going to go for "Unfathomed" but I like to live in the present, not in the past, so I went with Unfathoming. Plus the .ing exists and the word wasn't taken yet.

## Why a website?

My decision to build a minimalist{% sidenote "Good design can be minimalist" %} website stems from years of observing the volatile landscape{% sidenote "Both politically with censoring speech, as well as technologically with closures." %} of social media. While I've watched platforms rapidly rise to prominence only to fade into obscurity, personal websites seem to maintain a core audience that is there for the content, not just because an algorithm has addicted them. I believe that keeping this in mind, Unfathoming can outlive the popular social platforms. This self-hosted approach grants me independence from corporate whims and changing terms of service, ensuring that my ideas and research can theoretically last for centuries.

I'm a strong believer in self-sovereignty, which also extends to the sovereignty of the platform I choose to share my ideas on. Instead of screaming into the void of Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter{% sidenote "Supposedly its X now, but I won't call it that." %}, I wish to create my own space where I don't have to fight an algorithm for your attention.
