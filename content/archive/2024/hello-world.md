Iâ€™ve never cared much for New Years resolutions, but after being depressed most of 2023, I thought it was time for a change. For my 2024 New Years resolution, I promised myself that I would start a blog and write something every week.

## Why?
As I see it, content creation (especially writing) is the antithesis of content consumption, as it takes a conscious effort to compile your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a way that makes sense.

To free my mind from the chaos of life, and break the feedback loop, I need something productive to do that has a tangible output, like writing a blog post. So much of what goes on in my life currently is intangible. I write code that others use, and the only thing I receive in return is the potential that my code is used to work towards overseas projects.
