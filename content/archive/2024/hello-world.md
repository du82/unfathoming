Welcome to Unfathoming, a blog born from a New Year's resolution to improve my English writing skills. Inspired by the fascinating niche blogs I've encountered, I decided to carve out my own corner of the internet.

Here, I'll explore and share my thoughts, research, and experiences on a variety of topics, primarily centered around privacy, security, and other areas of computer science that interest me. My interests also extend to the darker corners of the internet, including the dark web and its implications for online anonymity, free markets, and censorship resistance.

## Why?
As I see it, content creation (especially writing) is [the antithesis of content consumption](/archive/2024/the-antithesis-of-content-consumption), as it takes a conscious effort to compile your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a way that makes sense to outsiders.

I've always wanted to improve my English skills, and maintaining a blog is a way to achieve that in a relatively low-stakes environment, away from the noise, trendiness, and engagement-seeking of the rest of the internet. This is also why my blog lacks a comment section or any way to contact me{% sidenote "I actively avoid social media and I don't have any accounts. If you see someone claiming to be me, they are lying." %}.

The IT industry is evolving, and much of the resulting output cannot be considered finished. There's always new updates to be shipped and new releases to follow. I was drawn towards writing for the exact opposite reason; when you're done writing and you hit the "commit changes" button, you can move on to the next topic.

## Why the name "Unfathoming"?
{% callout "note", "Definition of Unfathoming:<br>Unfathoming: Synonym of Unfathomable. Present tense. To find hard to believe, not in a way rooted in skepticism, but because it is a difficult reality to process."%}

I chose the name "Unfathoming" because it encapsulates both my personal life and the essence of the topics I plan to discuss on this blog. On the surface, my life might seem like that of an ordinary computer nerd, but beneath that exists a world of complexity that I even struggle to comprehend at times.

The name "Unfathoming" also hints at the depth of analysis I aim to provide. While many sources barely scratch the surface of complex topics such as the dark web while offering a sanitized or sensationalized narrative for clicks and views, I intend to dive deep into these subjects and offer honest, unfiltered opinions and thoughts as I go{% sidenote "Primarily through the use of sidenotes like this one." %}. My goal is to provide insights based on my decade of hands-on experience in computer science, challenging the mainstream and discussing topics that the media deliberately avoids.

## Why a website?

My decision to build a minimalist website stems from years of observing the volatile landscape{% sidenote "Both politically with censoring speech, as well as technologically with closures." %} of social media. While I've watched platforms rapidly rise to prominence only to fade into obscurity, personal websites seem to maintain a core audience that is there for the content, not just because an algorithm has addicted them. I believe that keeping this in mind, Unfathoming can outlive the popular social platforms{% sidenote "Helped by the fact that it is built using Markdown and other standards." %}. This self-hosted approach grants me independence from corporate whims and changing terms of service, ensuring that my ideas and research can theoretically last for centuries.

I'm a strong believer in self-sovereignty, which also extends to the sovereignty of the platform I choose to share my ideas on. Instead of screaming into the void of Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter{% sidenote "Supposedly its X now, but I won't call it that." %}, I wish to create my own space where I don't have to fight an algorithm for your attention.
