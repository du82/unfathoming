Iâ€™ve never cared much for New Years resolutions, but after being depressed most of 2023, I thought it was time for a change. For my 2024 New Years resolution, I promised myself that I would start a blog and write something every week.

## Why?
As I see it, content creation (especially writing) is the antithesis of content consumption, as it takes a conscious effort to compile your thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a way that makes sense.

To free my mind from the chaos of life, and break the feedback loop, I need something productive to do that has a tangible output, like writing a blog post. So much of what goes on in my life currently is intangible. I write code that others use, and the only thing I receive in return is the potential that my code is used to work towards overseas projects.

## Why the name "Unfathoming"?
{% callout "note", "Definition of Unfathoming:<br>*Unfathoming: Synonym of Unfathomable. Present tense. To find hard to believe, not in a way rooted in skepticism, but because it is a difficult reality to process.*"%}

I picked this name because it's a word that represents my life and who I am. I'm one of those people who has a boring life on the surface, but go a little deeper and you'll find that it's anything but boring. I was going to go for "Unfathomed" but I like to live in the present, not in the past, so I went with Unfathoming. Plus the .ing exists and the word wasn't taken yet.

## Why a website?
I created a clean, minimal website becuase I want something that can theoretically last for hundreds of years. Companies go out of business and terms of service change. I'm a strong believer in ownership over renting, and being able to put my entire site on an external drive for backup is such a freeing thing that Facebook won't give you.
