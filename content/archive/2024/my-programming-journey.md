Here's what I've been up to over the years. I'll provide source code and/or proof where possible. Many previous projects are deprecated but I still keep the code around.

# 2018

**311: Anonymous permanent file host**  
This is a project to create an unlimited file hosting service with zero identifiers. It was created because I was annoyed that the chat software I used limited file uploads to 25MB (which is still better than what Discord offers to this day lol). At its peak, it was storing over 40TB of data.

**Kowloon Networks**  
This is probably what led to you hearing about me as it is for most. _Digital Kowloon Walled City_ is an invite-only chat network dedicated to exposing the deep dark secrets of our world, specifically _that Asian country with a billion people_.

# 2019

**Android (java) app development**  
This year, I focused my efforts on the development of Bedrock Addons, a full stack Android app written in Java with a backend utilizing a standard LAMP stack, with an admin panel written in JavaScript.

**Three.js**  
I wrote a mini-game that utilized `Three.js` for graphics and real-time interaction. This mini-game was playable inside of Bedrock Addons and the first ten people to complete it won a Minecraft gift card.  
This is where I learned to hate JavaScipt

# 2020

_I didn't do much this year due to prolonged health struggles._{% sidenote "Not COVID" %}

# 2021 

**Tor storefront**  
I wrote a storefront that worked over Tor despite its limitations (like functioning without javascript) and other strict security mechanisms. I did not sell anything, it was a just functional proof of concept. I reinstalled my OS a week later without remembering to back up anything, and lost the source code (I use LUKS so recovery was impossible).

**Dapp development**  
I developed a Web3 decentralized app (dapp) that used `Web3.js` and quickly gave up after I realized that most Web3 dapps aren’t even decentralized, but instead hosted on Vercel, GitHub Pages, or other centralized providers with artificial requirements to log in with Ethereum added on top.

# 2022

**Flutter app development**  
This year I changed focus to developing a full stack mobile superapp utilizing Flutter and Dart. This was so much more enjoyable for me, since you design the page UI and logic in one file, compared to having a Java and XML file like you’d have in traditional Android development.{% sidenote "This project failed due to the plague known as dependency hell. I wish to bring it back someday."%}

**Clojure and React Native**  
I worked for [Status.app](https://status.app) and got to learn about React Native and Clojure development. Not a tech stack that I’d ever personally choose, but it worked and was fast enough to be usable. Status if you’re reading this, consider a rewrite using Flutter, it’ll save thousands of hours and headaches

# 2023

**Flutter app development**  
This year I changed focus to developing a full stack mobile superapp utilizing Flutter and Dart. This was so much more enjoyable for me, since you design the page UI and logic in one file, compared to having a Java and XML file like you’d have in traditional Android development.

**Learning Rust**  
This year I focused on learning the Rust programming language. I saw its intuitive packaging system for dependencies (which reminded me a lot of pub.dev) as well as the very helpful error messages, and I was immediately hooked.

**Matrix development**  
I also focused on the Matrix ecosystem and ended up writing lots of my software for it in the form of chat bots. I wrote every one of these chat bots in Rust as a test of my skills and a practical and fun way to learn the language.

# 2024

**Writing this website**  
On January 1st, 2024 I started this website. I’m not sure how it’ll go just yet, but I’m going to give it my best shot so I can improve my writing skills. The whole site is written in pure HTML and CSS, no CMS or anything in the middle.

**Aragoniteα**  
I have been building a programmatic search engine from scratch in Rust with an anonymous friend. I do the backend and some frontend, and my friend manages the datasets and some frontend UX design.
