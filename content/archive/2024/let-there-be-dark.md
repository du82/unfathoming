The idea that the government is generally more anti-privacy than pro-privacy is not a new one. Many governments hide behind the shadow of corporate surveillance to gather information on millions of people through subpoenas and coercion. The "Going Dark" problem is a real one for governments as it breaks the traditional model of relying on surveillance capitalism and allows free, unfettered access to send and recieve information and funds at scale.

End-to-end encrypted [communications](/archive/2024/chat-control-enriches-surveillance-state/) and [finance](/archive/2024/the-bitcoiners-were-wrong) are the primary of some of the largest governmental alliances. This leads to a problem where your every move is tracked, recorded, and used to build predictiions of what you'll do next. This isn't the future, it's our reality. You're living it right now.

While it's true that lawless digital environments *can* cause real world harm{% sidenote "Like the time a guy from Reddit chased me with a gun"%}, the benefits of strong cryptography and "Going Dark" outweigh the downsides.
