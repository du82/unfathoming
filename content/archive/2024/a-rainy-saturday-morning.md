Its a rainy Saturday morning, I'm sitting outside on a porch swing at 02:00 CST, and I'm wide awake, listening to music in a variety of languages of which I don't understand, and digging through code like a centipede digging through insulation looking for its next meal.

I'm rewriting my website to use 11ty (or is it Eleventy?), the lightweight static site generator.
