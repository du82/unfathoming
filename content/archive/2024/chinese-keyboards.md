In the digital age, the keyboards on our phones serve as the primary interface between our thoughts and the online world. For Chinese speakers, this interface comes with a hidden cost. Every known proprietary Chinese input method monitors user behavior, and without reasonably useful open source offerings, users are forced to self-censor to avoid detection.

For those who don't know what makes a Chinese keyboard different from a regular QWERTY keyboard (they use the same layout), most Chinese keyboards include a PinYin inference algorithm that attempts to figure out the best glyph for the latin letters typed.
