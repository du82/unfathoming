I've recently been running into the problem of centralized moderation lists. Let me explain:

Over a year ago, I was added to the matrix.org mjolnir autoban list for sharing views on the Russo-Ukrainian war that run contrary to the mainstream narrative. This was never a problem because I run my own infrastructure, and I didn't even notice that I was banned due to the fact that I opeate my own parallel infrastructure that doesn't ban anyone unless there's legal pressure to do so. I recently went to check out `#help:t2bot.io` and I was immediately banned by `@abuse:t2bot.io`.

I thought this was quite odd considering I didn't even get the chance to send a message, so I dug deeper. It turns out, I am banned from over 150 chat rooms, and the room creators don't even know that I'm banned until I attempt to join those rooms and the bot bans me.

What's worse is the fact that upon alerting a human to the issue, they told me there's nothing they can do to let me in and that I would have to make a new account to evade the ban that they didn't even know existed.
