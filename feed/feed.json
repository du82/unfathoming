			"title": "Why I use Linux",
			"content_html": "<p>Lots of people ask me why I use Linux, so I thought I'd put it here. TLDR; I use Linux because its the only option that respects the user and doesn't spy on them.</p>\n<p>If you've used Windows in recent years, you've probably noticed a sharp decline in usability, an increase in ads, and a general enshittification of the platform. I'll break down all of the things that anger me with other operating systems. Prepare for a rant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"control\" tabindex=\"-1\">Control <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/why-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When I use Windows and (especially) MacOS, I feel like I don't have much control over the system. I want to do updates if and when I want. I do not want the Microsoft Corporation telling me its time to update.</p>\n<p>In addition to controlling if and when I update, I also want to control what background processes are happening on my system. I do not want Teams, Edge, Bing, or anything else running around on my system without my consent. I want to be able to uninstall any software I want, even if it has the possibility of breaking my system. Windows and MacOS come with lots of bloatware, and there's no easy way to remove it, thus, you do not truly own your computer when you run Windows or MacOS on it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Privacy <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/why-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I don't want Microsoft or Apple virtually looking over my shoulder or scanning my files. I deal with a lot of sensitive information, and the files on my machines need to be under my control. I do not want Microsoft enabling OneDrive and uploading all of my data to their cloud after one of the many mandatory updates. Privacy is one of my core values, and is something that both Windows and MacOS violate.</p>\n<p>From the moment you set up a Windows machine, you're begged for a Microsoft account, and you either need to use registry hacks or change your location to the United Kingdom to bypass the mandatory Microsoft account page. Most users sigh and create an account or sign in with an existing one, without realizing that this ties all of what you do to that account.</p>\n<p>Both of these problems are eliminated with Linux. None of the popular distributions require online accounts, and the majority don't even ask for them at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\" tabindex=\"-1\">Security <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/why-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Without a doubt, Windows is a security shitshow. Downloading EXEs from the internet should've been deprecated long ago in favor of a package manager, yet here were are in 2024 with malicious downloads still being a huge problem.</p>\n<p>This is also not a big problem on #linux. Sure, malware exists, but if you stick to verified repositories and don't download random .deb files from the first search result you see, you'll be fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"drivers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Drivers <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/why-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Hunting down and installing drivers feels like something that should've been solved for in the year 2000, yet I did that just last week for someone. Shipping drivers with the kernel causes less issues, improves security, and makes installing the distro a far more seamless experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Politics <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/why-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I just want my computer to do the basics without getting political. I don't care about pride month, black history month, or anything else that Windows loves to shove into the search box or other UI elements. None of it interests me, I just want a computer that does computing, not American politics.</p>\n<p>Linux distro developers don't try to force American politics on users. Keep up the great work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"respects-default-settings\" tabindex=\"-1\">Respects default settings <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/why-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you've used Windows 11, you probably have had the experience of having to change your default browser back to Chrome or Firefox from Edge every few months.</p>\n<p>Firefox is usually the default, and while I don't use non-chromium browsers (besides Tor), I appreciate that it's not forced and I can change it to whatever I want.</p>\n<p>AI (or lack thereof)\nAI can be great (when its not politically biased), but I don't want it in my OS or apps. Both Windows and MacOS fall into the &quot;shiny hype train&quot; trap by including AI. If I want AI, then I will visit the ChatGPT website or install an offline AI program for more privacy, but don't force it on me.</p>\n<p>Sadly there are some Linux distros that have hopped on the AI hype train, but thankfully none of the more popular ones have.</p>\n",

			"title": "The tragedy of Discord",
			"content_html": "<p>Recently I’ve seen more and more communities utilizing Discord (the social chat app) as a means of organization and communication. It’s not just the big names either, it seems to be every community that isn’t privacy focused, as well as most “Web3” communities.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help migrate users away from IRC, Discord chose to name their communities “servers”. Servers in this context are nothing more than folders where text files (which they call channels) are stored. It is impossible to host a Discord server on your own hardware.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"discord-is-bad-for-the-open-web\" tabindex=\"-1\">Discord is bad for the open web <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You’ve probably heard someone complain about the LinkedIn authentication popups that require you to sign in to view content. The frustration you feel when you go to check on someones profile, only to be hit with a “sign up to LinkedIn” prompt is the same frustration I and others feel towards communities on Discord.</p>\n<p>Instead of the answer to your problem existing on a forum that’s indexed by the major search engines, you spend hours digging around just to realize that the solution is buried deep inside of a community on Discord, and the only way to view it is to let them collect your data so you can join what should’ve been a public forum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"centralization\" tabindex=\"-1\">Centralization <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We put a huge emphasis on privacy and do not track the user or attempt to associate their queries with any identifiers like an IP or cookie. Both our clearnet and Tor mirrors run all logic on the backend, meaning no JavaScript or WASM on the frontend. The entire search engine has been designed with the idea that someday we may get a subpoena, and we want to confidently tell the lawyers that we collect only the absolute minimum required to operate and we don’t even store it on disk (memory-only).</p>\n<p>We see no reason for Google, Bing, or others to store every search you make over the entire history of your account, unless they’re selling it to the CIA or something. Spooky!</p>\n<h2 id=\"absolutely-proprietary\" tabindex=\"-1\">Absolutely proprietary <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Despite the claims by the company that “Discord loves open-source” they in fact do not. Nothing about Discord is open source beyond some of the GPL licensed projects that they rely on for their own code. This doesn’t sound like a company that loves open source and wants to contribute back. This sounds like a company that loves open source because it makes their own development cheaper.</p>\n<p>Those that have attempted to reverse engineer and re-implement the Discord technology stack in an open-source way have been hit with legal notices. Just look at what they did to Fosscord and other projects that are re-implementations of their specification.</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-operators-are-powerless\" tabindex=\"-1\">Server operators are powerless <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As a server operator, you are powerless against the platform. You have no say in what features they decide to add or remove, and what other things they do. There have been instances where Discord have purposely made the platform worse for some users as an April Fools joke. Is that the kind of platform you want to rely on?</p>\n<h2 id=\"moderators-have-no-say\" tabindex=\"-1\">Moderators have no say <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When the company introduces new features, they are typically Nitro (their 10 dollar monthly subscription) exclusive, or severely limited unless you pay. To access some of these features, your community must be paying for Nitro in order to get “Boosts” which can be used to make your server significantly more useful to everyone. The main problem? This collectively costs 140 dollars per month for the highest tier, and it is on a per-server basis. Every server that wants a decent experience must expect their members to collectively cough up $140 a month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moderators-have-no-power\" tabindex=\"-1\">Moderators have no power <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Unlike hosting your own community forum or Matrix server, you cannot ban a block of IPs that are used by adversaries to evade bans on Discord. Why? You do not own your server, the company does. The only one with power over your community is Discord themselves. This is a problem for server operators since Discord has very weak alt detection and ban evasion is trivial, as the checks happen client side.</p>\n<p>Discord lulls you into a false sense of ownership and control, when in reality you own nothing beyond the branding of the server and the messages you send. Put bluntly, if Discord decides you don't make them enough money, or you mention alternative platforms, they can delete a community you've built over years and you can do nothing about it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moderators-have-no-privacy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Moderators have no privacy <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Neither do their communities. For the communities that are intentionally private (meaning they have no public invite links), they also have no privacy. All it takes is one data breach or a misconfiguring of permissions, and your entire chat history including deleted messages is open to the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"end-users-are-powerless-as-well\" tabindex=\"-1\">End users are powerless as well <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As an end user, you have no power or control over the platform. Just like server operators, you have no say in what features the company chooses to add or remove, and without using a custom client, you have no way to fix the intentionally bad design unless you pay for the Nitro monthly or yearly subscription.</p>\n<h2 id=\"users-have-no-say\" tabindex=\"-1\">Users have no say <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As a user of Discord, you have absolutely zero say in how the platform is run. In fact, the platform is designed to push users towards its Nitro subscription by restricting users who don’t pay, and imposing artificial limitations upon them.</p>\n<p>A good example of this is themes. Users have been using tools like BetterDiscord to customize the look and feel of the platform. Some users do this for accessibility, although most do it because the default experience is just plain awful. What does Discord do in this case? They add themes for 10 dollars a month and start banning users who openly talk about their use of client modifications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"users-have-no-power\" tabindex=\"-1\">Users have no power <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You have no power or control over Discord, your data, or your account. You can’t even have the option to sue them unless you let them know and tell them your legal name and other personal information within a month of creating your account, regardless of if you actually plan to sue them, which is not something you should want to give a company that works with the Chinese government.</p>\n<h2 id=\"users-have-no-privacy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Users have no privacy <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You have no control or insight into how Discord uses your data. This should scare you, especially considering their investment and data sharing agreements with Tencent; a company with an awful track record regarding privacy.</p>\n<p>Your DMs on Discord are not end-to-end encrypted, which means employ ees can read your messages. Their “trust and safety” employees are untrustworthy, and have been known to read the direct messages of their friends, as well as ban users entire accounts as a joke. Privacy and anonymity do not exist on Discord at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-platform-is-a-disaster\" tabindex=\"-1\">The platform is a disaster <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Discord compels users to follow their Terms Of Service by threatening to delete their accounts, but then never does anything about the outsiders who abuse the platform. This leads to a situation where consequences only apply to legitimate users who want to keep their accounts. Bots, spammers, and loggers can do whatever they want.\nFunny how that works, isn't it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-this-a-tragedy\" tabindex=\"-1\">What makes this a tragedy? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://unfathom.ing/unfathoming/blog/2024/the-tragedy-of-discord/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>People have willingly given up the freedoms and privacy that they had on IRC and Matrix to move towards a centralized platform that is hostile towards them, does not care about them, and actively exploits them for monetary benefit.</p>\n<p>Instead of decentralized communities that are truly owned by their leaders / moderators, millions of people moved away from IRC and other decentralized offerings towards the flashy marketing and gamer aesthetic™. People have willingly given up freedoms and privacy for convenience and in the process they’ve also lost what made the early internet communities special; their sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Discord does not care about you, despite the flashy marketing. Discord does not care about people with disabilities, despite their modern UI. Your privacy is an obstacle to their success. If you’re thinking about starting a Discord server, please consider an alternative such as self hosting Element, or if you must have the Discord UI and don't mind a strong liberal bias, Revolt is an open-source option that might work for you.</p>\n",
