<p>Welcome to the new Unfathoming. I've gone through three notable iterations of the site now, first on <a href="">quartz</a> by Jacky Zhao, second entirely static, with me manually writing HTML for every single page (and dealing with the consequences of trying to keep 50+ pages looking consistent), and thirdly (hopefully finally) what you're looking at right now.</p>
<p>The new site is written with the <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> static site generator because it's super simple with few dependencies and it is something I could learn in a <a href="/blog/2024/a-rainy-saturday-morning">morning before sunrise</a>.</p>

<p>While most people use WordPress, I hate how long simple actions take. Even just loading a page can take a long time, and I didn't want to deal with the security nightmare of WordPress either. I've operated WP sites in the past, and every single one of them was compromised in some form or another, despite having what I thought was above average security. I guess that's just part of the PHP plague.</p>
<p>Something interesting about the site is that if I want to show the graph above, I type out the following:</p>
<pre class="language-js" tabindex="0"><code class="language-js"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token operator">%</span> image <span class="token string">"g2.png"</span> <span class="token operator">%</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>and it knows to pull the rendered and optimized image from <code>/assets/graphs/g2.png</code>. How? It looks for the first letter <code>g</code> and knows that's associated with a graph, then looks at the number to determine which numbered graph to use, and the file extension is there to tell it which to render the final output in. I could've just as easily made it say <code>png2</code> or something else, but I like how natural it feels. <code>g2.png</code> isn't actually the name of the file, its a way of locating and displaying the file.</p>

<p>The site has no javascript. Well, it does have one tracking thing from CloudFlare, but its not necessary and only helps me figure out how AI scrapers are getting around the firewall.</p>
<h2 id="sidenotes" tabindex="-1">Sidenotes <a class="header-anchor" href="#sidenotes">#</a></h2>
<p>I've also written a sidenotes mechanism similar to how <a href="https://gwern.net">Gwern</a> does it. It's nice to be able to add additional commentary that doesn't fit the text well enough, or share my thoughts on what someone has said.<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-1" href="#sidenote-1">1</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-1">Isn't this neat? It can be as long as it needs to be, or it can even contain images, although I doubt I'd ever do something like that.</span></p>
<p>Sidenotes automatically attach themselves to the right side of the text and scroll with the content, which also could act as a nice way to show a timeline of thoughts throughout writing an article or events through a story that didn't make the cut. The sidenotes are only available on devices with large screens. A desktop, laptop, or iPad should work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="callouts" tabindex="-1">Callouts <a class="header-anchor" href="#callouts">#</a></h2>
<p>Callouts (also known as callout cards) are also added as a way to draw attention to something specific. Eleventy doesn't support sidenotes or callout cards by default but it was very simple to implement them.</p>
<div class="callout info">I'm a callout card!</div>
<h2 id="what-else" tabindex="-1">What else <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-else">#</a></h2>
<p>I'm not sure yet, it's still in development, but this is what has been added on the third revision of the site. I'll update this post if more is added or changed.</p>
