<p>The European Union has proposed a bill known as <a href="https://unfathom.ing">CSAR</a> (often referred to as Chat Control), which was proposed as a way to protect children online through the use of mandatory client-side scanning of encrypted messages.</p>
<p>Specifically, the bill would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandate scanning of all private chats, messages, and emails for suspicious content, including on end-to-end encrypted services</li>
<li>Use AI and other technologies to scan content before it is encrypted or transmitted</li>
<li>Apply to all communication services, including messaging apps, email providers, and cloud storage services</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the fact that <a href="https://simplex.chat/blog/20240601-protecting-children-safety-requires-e2e-encryption.html">protecting children's safety requires end-to-end encryption</a>, regulators have attempted to push Chat Control as the answer.</p>
<p>Lets not sugarcoat it: the chat control proposal is designed to take away freedoms from the average person and enrich governmental surveillance powers. Why else would <a href="https://www.eureporter.co/business/data/mass-surveillance-data/2024/04/15/leak-eu-interior-ministers-want-to-exempt-themselves-from-chat-control-bulk-scanning-of-private-messages/">EU interior ministers want to exempt themselves</a> from the scanning? Or, why would Germany <a href="https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/german-lawmakers-have-not-voted-decriminalise-possessing-child-pornography-2024-06-19/">want to reduce sentences for those who posess or distribute illegal material</a>?</p>
<p><em>Think about the children</em> they say out loud, while exempting themselves from their own proposed regulation. It isn't about the children, <strong>it's about control</strong> over the collective consciousness of citizens in the European Union.</p>
