<p>I thought I'd reflect on the past two years of college and share the thoughts with you all.</p>
<p>I started college roughly two years ago after pressure from family to go. I reluctantly went, despite people in the industry telling me it didn't help them. From the beginning I thought of college from the perspective of <em>&quot;I'm the customer, your job is to teach me something new and introduce me to concepts I didn't think of&quot;</em>, which I think is a fair trade considering the steep cost.</p>
<p>The first semester was fine, I expected a slow start becuase they have to bring everyone up to speed with the industry and work with a wide variety of skillsets, from experts to people who have never used a computer before. The first semester was nothing special, it was all content that you could teach yourself in a weekend with some YouTube videos and free software (except for a math class which was pretty good and taught me a lot).</p>
<p>Something that I noticed early on was that most of the course content was 5-10 years out of date. For a cybersecurity degree, this is awful! The virtual machines we used were from 2019 (which was five years ago now!). I thought it was just becuase we're starting out, and I hoped that it would improve. <em>Little did I know, it was foreshadowing</em>.</p>
<p>I thought to myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why am I paying $500 a course for online classes where the teacher takes a week to respond to a simple question, and the course content is purchased from sites like Teachers Pay Teachers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the first year was more of the same. At this point I realized that professors were using AI to respond to students, which bothered me considering the cost. Really? Can't they take a few hours out of their day to answer questions that they should know the answers to? <em>This is more foreshadowing</em>.</p>
<h2 id="summer-classes" tabindex="-1">Summer classes <a class="header-anchor" href="#summer-classes">#</a></h2>
<p>I took two online summer courses to maximize the amount of credits per year. One was an interpersonal communications class, the other was a class on ethics, morals, and philosophical things. Lets just say they had a strong liberal bias<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-1" href="#sidenote-1">1</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-1">Far beyond what would be considered normal education, moving into the realm of forcing it on us</span> that even people I know on the left weren't ok with (I'm a centrist) and leave it at that.</p>
<h2 id="second-semester" tabindex="-1">Second semester <a class="header-anchor" href="#second-semester">#</a></h2>
<p>The second semester was more of the same. I learned how to manage a four year old version of Active Directory which may be useful someday when I need to set up AD things for an organization. Still, nothing that I couldn't learn on my own, especially since I run my own virtual machine infrastructure with Proxmox at a global scale :)</p>
<p>One class was essentially using AI to make presentations about a topic and turn in the presentation. This is also when I realized that quite a few teachers were using AI to generate course content and feedback. That same class was interesting because the teacher introduced me to a former student who had similar interests on the surface. Lesson learned: Don't put a cryptoanarchist and a moralist together. It did not go well.</p>
<p>The rest of my second semester was more of the same from the first semester, but it seemed to have gotten <em><strong>worse</strong></em> than the first semester! An example of this being configuring an AWS EC2 instance, gaining shell access, and installing some software on it. That part was fine, but there was no instruction on how to secure it. A little odd for a cybersecurity course/degree, right?<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-2" href="#sidenote-2">2</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-2">Seriously, you're going to teach us about the cloud and not talk about securing it at all? I'm lost for words!</span></p>
<h2 id="the-ai-witch-hunt" tabindex="-1">The AI witch hunt <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-ai-witch-hunt">#</a></h2>
<p>About half way through the second semester, people started talking on various Signal groups about how they were getting grades changed to zeros. Around this time I also recieved an email telling me that I was on the college's naughty list for using AI (despite a teacher recommending its use and calling it revolutionary)<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-3" href="#sidenote-3">3</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-3">That teacher even suggested we use it to create presentations for that class!</span>. I shrugged this off, moved on, and registered for summer and next semester classes a week later.</p>
<p>I was called in to talk to the dean of the IT department (which is apparently standard practice), and he (along with the assistant dean) told me that they didn't like how I was selling premium versions of AI tools to anyone who was willing to hand over $5 per month.</p>
<p>During the meeting, I explained that I proxy API access from a variety of paid AI services so that others can use them for cheaper than if they paid for them directly (one license for many people vs many licenses for one person). Neither the dean nor the assistant dean seemed to understand, which surprised me considering the field in which they worked. The assistant said &quot;these are free sites&quot;, to which I responded with the difference between the free and paid versions, being increased speed, reliability, and accuracy. Neither of them seemed to acknowledge this, and they continued to be condecending.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the dean and assistant dean: Go educate yourselves on what an API is. Also, I will never tell you who was paying me for AI tools, I don't rat people out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="suspicious-google-account-activity" tabindex="-1">Suspicious Google account activity <a class="header-anchor" href="#suspicious-google-account-activity">#</a></h2>
<p>I logged into one of my <strong>personal</strong> Google accounts, and noticed suspicious activity. I investigated further, and found that whoever it was had snooped through the Gmail, Drive, Pay, Ads, and MyActivity products. I revoked the associated session and forgot about it. Little did I know, this was teachers at the college who had gained access and were poking around.</p>
<h2 id="the-letter" tabindex="-1">The letter <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-letter">#</a></h2>
<p>I recieved a letter of suspension, which I expected, but I didn't expect their &quot;evidence&quot; to include screenshots of them logged into that <strong>personal</strong> Google account showing the Gemini API with a variety of queries that I wouldn't be dumb enough to type out even if I was drunk, high, and half asleep. <em>Do you think someone who's <a href="/blog/2024/building-a-search-engine">developing a search engine</a> in Rust, utiliznig VS Code, and developing exclusively for Unix targets would type &quot;how to open the terminal in ubuntu&quot;?</em>
The policy mentioned that you're not automatically allowed back when the time is up, you have to send an <em>appology letter</em> and have them review it to let you back in.</p>
<h2 id="post-letter" tabindex="-1">Post-letter <a class="header-anchor" href="#post-letter">#</a></h2>
<p>I recieved multiple emails telling me I had a bill due. I shrugged them off because I couldn't drop the classes or do any of the work. After talking to an enrollment person (who didn't seem to give a flying fuck), I was told that the two classes would still show up on the transcript because they were never dropped, despite me being unable to do anything with them. I was also still going to be billed for them since they had already started.</p>
<p>To recap, I was suspended by people who didn't know the facts and rummaged through a personal account with no relation to the college, then billed for classes that I couldn't drop or do anything with, and then was told they'd also show up on the record, making me take even more classes to up the GPA if I wanted to graduate.
The funny thing is that in a year or two, AI will be normalized just as the cloud is today.</p>
<p>What has college taught me?</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend more time on opsec when selling AI tools to other students<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-4" href="#sidenote-4">4</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-4">Definitely don't stop selling AI tools to students, keep doing it, just quieter this time!</span></li>
<li>Don't buy textbooks, just keep making new O'Riley accounts and use their free trial, then make another account when time is up</li>
<li>Don't waste time learning their outdated materials, just teach yourself the modern stuff.</li>
<li>College is a capitalist scam, you can succeed without it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="update-1-26-6-2024" tabindex="-1">Update #1: 26/6/2024 <a class="header-anchor" href="#update-1-26-6-2024">#</a></h2>
<p>The college has blocked multiple of my domains (only about 7% of them lol), which lends credibility to my theory that they don't like my comms platform but they couldn't suspend me over it since it has no relation to the college. After calling last friday (21st) and getting told to contact the assistant dean, I left a voicemail asking the assistant dean to call back. No response. I contacted multiple people with no responses or very unhelpful responses.</p>
<p>I contacted the registrar who told me &quot;they'll be in contact&quot;<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-5" href="#sidenote-5">5</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-5">Who is They? Does she mean the assistant dean? Or is it enrollment?</span>. After pushing again, I recieved the exact same response. I was also locked out of my school accounts shortly after, as well as the place to download my transcripts, and told that I'd still need to pay $1100 for classes <em>that I couldn't attend, drop, or do anything with</em>.</p>
<p>The conversation goes as follows, word-for-word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her: &quot;I'm calling you back about your situation with your tuition and dropping classes, I did talk to a couple people so I emailed them. Everybody has all their information and I'm sure they will get back to you, Ok?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &quot;Okay&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her: &quot;Alright&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &quot;So what is that&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her: &quot;They'll get back to you&quot;<a class="sidenote-anchor" id="sidenote-6" href="#sidenote-6">6</a><span class="sidenote" aria-describedby="sidenote-6">Again, who is they?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &quot;Okay, so they'll let me know what's up? or&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her: &quot;Yes, they will.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &quot;Alright, I appreciate it&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This call just left me with more questions than answers. So far, I keep getting bounced around to different people, and they've definitely</p>
